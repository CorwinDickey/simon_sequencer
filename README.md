## Overview
We were given a choice of 5 different games to recreate in a web browser format, in order to showcase the skills we learned in module 1. I chose to emulate the Simon game.

### Notes On Changes From Wireframe to Final Design
As I was going through the creation of this project, I discovered that my initial scope was too big. I had wanted to add several features beyond the requirements of the project. I came to the realization that I could either have lots of cool features that were poorly implemented, or I could meet the requirements and provide a refined product.

## Future Development
* Add sounds to cue user
* Capture user name and high score
* Allow user to choose difficulty (how many rounds in a game)
